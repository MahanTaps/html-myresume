    <h3>Something About Me</h3>
    <p>I am an aspiring programmer, part-time student, and part-time tutor. When I'm not working or studying, I usually work out (out of necessity), hang out with friends and family, 
        or stay in and watch TV or do a little bit of reading here and there. 
        At least once a week, I'm in a random chruch contemplating the burden of existence and the poor state of my soul, but that's another story. 
        I have the body and the mind to live independently, so each day I focus my efforts on making that a reality. 
        I enjoy coding and working with computers because it's an immense field, and I find myself getting sucked in for hours. 
        This is the life stream of the moden world-- our entire society is built on computers. 
        Being able to understand this force and bend it to my will fills me with a sense of  awe and gratitude.</p>
